                    This site is the exam project for the NodeJS elective subject at KEA 2023. <br />
                    It is designed with seperate frontend and backend. The frontend uses Svelte+Vite, toasts and svelte-routing. <br />
                    The backend uses JWT auth system, MySQL database, helmet, bcrypt, cors, ratelimit and nodemailer w/ ethereal.mail on registration.<br />
                    It also features the concurrently node module, to start both the frontend and backend with a single npm run command from
                    the root directory.<br />
                    <br />
                    The site displays the elements of the universe, both observed and theoretical, neatly in the periodic table with a lot of data.<br />
