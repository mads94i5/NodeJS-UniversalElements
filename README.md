# Universal Elements

This project is the exam assignment for the NodeJS elective subject at KEA 2023. 
It is designed with seperate frontend and backend.
The frontend uses Svelte+Vite, toasts and svelte-routing
The backend uses JWT auth system, MySQL, MongoDB, helmet, bcrypt, cors, ratelimit and nodemailer w/ ethereal.mail.
It also features the concurrently node module, to start both the frontend and backend with a single npm run command from the root directory.

## Assignment

Both individual and group work is allowed. You still need to understand all the code. Collaborations across electives are also allowed.

Deadline: Check Wiseflow for when the hand-in deadline is. You must submit a full stack project by then but you can still work on your project up until the exam. You will only be evaluated based on the final project. Upload a Git link to your project (PDF) or the code as a zip file (requires an empty PDF first).

Scope: There should be enough features that you can talk incessantly for 5-6 minutes while showcasing your product.

Hard requirements: You need to fulfill these requirements to pass the exam:

Backend

· Use Express

· Use a database (You need access to your database through the terminal and be able to write your own queries to it during the exam). Choose the appropriate database for your project. You are expected to research and make an informed choice.

· Use Sockets.

· Authentication and authorization.

Frontend

· Plain HTML, template engines or Svelte are okay.

· Use Fetch.

· Use Sockets.

· Authentication and authorization.

Soft requirements (You should fulfill these too):

You must have a clean code base and your code style should be consistent.

You must make an attempt at styling your website. Styling frameworks can be used. User experience is important too.

Bonus:

Host your application.

Hard Requirement:

Whether the project is hosted or not both the project and the product need to be production ready which means that the:

· code shouldn’t be littered with console logs, unused code, unfinished snippets etc.

· product is legal and conform to GDPR.

Exam: Language: Danish

Be prepared. The project should be up and running.

Demo your exam project (First 5-6 minutes):

Demo means no code but constantly showing features.

Since auth was a part of mandatory II only demo it if it has additional features. Otherwise focus on what is unique to your exam project. Don’t show how to log in or sign up.

I might seem impatient during the demo part but it’s because I use the measured time it takes to demo unique features of the system to place you in a grade category. Expect me to instruct you if the demo sidetracks or is slowed down by explanations. If talking during the demo part means not showcasing features then a silent demo is preferred. A good project would be self-explanatory through its UI / UX. The goal is not to create a stressful exam but for me to create an objective measurement to the grading system.

Discussion: We will talk about your exam project. Code and more.

Live Coding: You will be asked to live code! Either right away if I noticed some things about your project or in the end.

You are not allowed to use snippets or code assisting tools (Copilot etc.) during the exam. IntelliSense is allowed.
